# PyTorch-HDPGMM

a `pytorch` implementation of `hierarchical Dirichlet process Gaussian mixture model (HDPGMM)`.


## TODOs

- [ ] turning into CSR-like layout; 'masked-array-of-variable-sequence' is not worth for the computational efficiency while make the memory efficiency terrible. (especially on GPU)
- [ ] continuous doc with Travis + Sphinx + Github pages (see [this](https://github.com/icgood/continuous-docs))
